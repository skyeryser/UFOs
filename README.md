## Overview of the analysis
This project aims to develop a web app that allows users to filter on various UFO sightings. In the app, UFO enthusiasts can filter on any of five filters, including the date, state, city, country, and shape of the UFO sighting.

## Results
The UFO Sightings is a web app funded by W. Avy, a UFO enthusiast, and amateur Ufologist. It contains information regarding various UFO sightings in January 2010.

The UFO Sightings app allows users to search for UFO sightings based on any combination of the following filters:
    
Once the user has input their chosen filters, they can press enter on their keyboard, and the data table to the right of the webpage will update based on the specified filters. In the example below, the user has filtered all the sightings in the city of Seattle. 

Once the table is updated according to the user's filters, the webpage needs to be refreshed before another search can be performed.

## Summary & Recommendations
1. One drawback of this webpage is that the user must type the filter criteria in the filter box exactly as the criteria are formatted in the data table. This formatting could be more intuitive, especially for city, state, and country filters. If the user capitalizes these criteria, the filter will not filter the table correctly.
2. The first opportunity for improving the UFO Sightings webpage is to add a keyword search for the comments section of the data table. This update would allow users to hone in on specific events, colors, movements, and other adjectives that they think are worth investigating. Furthermore, the webpage only includes one month of data from 2010. It needs to be updated to stay relevant. It would be beneficial to have a web form that users can use to add their own UFO sightings to the webpage. The webpage could stay up-to-date with more recent UFO sightings with user input.
